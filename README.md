# 🐳 Docker Image Optimization Guide

Docker image optimization is crucial for creating lightweight applications, speeding up deployments, and saving storage space. Without optimization, unnecessary files, packages, and development tools can be included in the Docker image, leading to the following issues:

### Why Optimize Docker Images? 🧐

1. **Faster Deployment 🚀**: Larger images take longer to download or upload, especially in cloud environments, causing slow deployments. Optimized images lead to quicker and more efficient deployments.
   
2. **Reduced Storage Costs 💰**: Storing large images in the cloud can incur higher storage costs. Managing multiple images without optimization can significantly increase costs.

3. **Enhanced Security 🔒**: Unnecessary packages and libraries increase the surface area for security vulnerabilities. By including only the necessary files and libraries, optimization can reduce security risks.

4. **Improved Performance ⚡**: Smaller images reduce memory usage and container startup times, boosting application performance and efficiency.

## Optimization Methods & Code Examples 💡

### 1. Use a Lightweight Base Image 🏋️‍♂️

Using full-version operating systems like `ubuntu` or `debian` as base images can increase the image size. You can reduce the size by using **Alpine Linux** or other lightweight base images.

- **Example**: Replacing `openjdk:17` with `openjdk:17-alpine` for a lightweight version.

```dockerfile
# Before Optimization
FROM openjdk:17
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
CMD ["java", "Main"]

# After Optimization (Using lightweight base image)
FROM openjdk:17-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
CMD ["java", "Main"]
```

- **Result**: The base image `openjdk:17` is about 643MB, while `openjdk:17-alpine` is only around 250MB.

---

### 2. Use Multi-stage Builds 🏗️

Multi-stage builds separate the build environment from the runtime environment, ensuring that build tools and dependencies are not included in the final image.

- **Example**: Using `javac` during the build stage but excluding it from the final runtime stage.

```dockerfile
# Build Stage
FROM openjdk:17 AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN javac Main.java  # Build tool used only here

# Runtime Stage
FROM openjdk:17-jre-slim  # Slim JRE version for runtime
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/Main.class .
CMD ["java", "Main"]
```

- **Result**: By excluding the build tools, the final image size is significantly reduced.

---

### 3. Remove Unnecessary Files & Cache 🧹

Using a `.dockerignore` file, you can exclude unnecessary files or directories during the build process. This avoids adding source code, logs, and other irrelevant files to the Docker image.

- **Example**: Using `.dockerignore` to exclude unnecessary files.

```plaintext
# .dockerignore example
.git
*.log
node_modules/
*.tmp
```

- **Optimized Dockerfile Example**:

```dockerfile
# Before Optimization
FROM node:16
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm install
CMD ["npm", "start"]

# After Optimization (Removing cache)
FROM node:16
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install --production && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*  # Remove cache
COPY . .
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

- **Result**: Unnecessary files are excluded, and package manager cache is removed, reducing the image size.

---

### 4. Minimize Image Layers 🎂

Each instruction in a `Dockerfile` (like `RUN`, `COPY`, `ADD`) creates a new layer. By minimizing layers and combining commands into a single instruction, you can reduce the image size.

- **Example**: Combining multiple commands into one `RUN` instruction.

```dockerfile
# Before Optimization
FROM ubuntu:20.04
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip
RUN pip3 install flask

# After Optimization (Minimizing layers)
FROM ubuntu:20.04
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip && pip3 install flask
```

- **Result**: Fewer layers mean a smaller image size.

---

### 5. Use `docker-slim` for Automatic Optimization ✨

`docker-slim` is a tool that automatically optimizes Docker images by removing unnecessary files and libraries. It reduces the size of Docker images without changing their functionality.

- **Installation & Usage**:
  
```bash
# Install docker-slim
curl -sL https://github.com/docker-slim/docker-slim/releases/download/1.38.0/dist_linux.sh | sudo bash

# Optimize the image
docker-slim build <image_name>
```

- **Example**:
  
```bash
docker-slim build my-java-app
```

- **Result**: Automatically reduces the image size by removing unnecessary components.

---

## Summary of Optimization Benefits 📝

Each method can significantly reduce the size of your Docker images, leading to faster deployments and improved performance. For example, using a **lightweight base image** combined with **multi-stage builds** can turn hundreds of megabytes into just tens of megabytes.

# 🚀 Practice with Image Optimization and Alert Script

## 🌟 Overview
This Python script is designed to optimize Docker images using multi-stage builds and send email alerts if the image size exceeds a defined threshold (500MB). The script checks the size of a Docker image, sends an alert if the size is too large, and proceeds to build an optimized version of the image. Once the size is reduced, it sends another alert indicating that the image is below the size limit.

## ✨ Features
- 📏 **Check Docker Image Size**: Verifies the size of a Docker image using the `docker image inspect` command.
- 🔧 **Multi-stage Build Optimization**: Reduces the final image size by using a multi-stage build. The build process compiles the necessary files in a separate stage and copies only the compiled output to the final image.
- ✉️ **Email Alerts**: Sends email notifications if the image size exceeds 500MB, both before and after optimization.

### 1. `check_image_size(image_name)`
- **Purpose**: This function checks the size of a Docker image in megabytes (MB).
- **How**: Uses the `docker image inspect` command to retrieve the image size in bytes and converts it to MB.
- **Return**: The image size or an error message if the size cannot be retrieved.

### 2. `send_alert(image_name, size_mb, stage="initial")`
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a81e9102-8d1f-4b67-bead-d1995c692fd4)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b7806b4-003d-43b8-8540-6165c2cc8b9f)
- **Purpose**: This function sends an email alert when the Docker image exceeds a certain size threshold.
- **How**: Uses `smtplib` to send an email through Gmail's SMTP server.
- **Content**: The alert message contains the image name, size, and stage (either "initial" or "optimized").

### 3. `optimize_image(image_name)`
- **Purpose**: This function optimizes the Docker image using a multi-stage build.
- **How**: Creates a Dockerfile dynamically and uses multi-stage build to reduce the final image size.
  - The build process compiles the Java application in the first stage and copies the compiled output into a slim image.

### 4. 🛠️ Main Script Logic
- **Step 1**: The script first checks the size of the specified Docker image.
- **Step 2**: If the size exceeds 500MB, it sends an initial email alert.
- **Step 3**: The script then builds an optimized version of the image using a multi-stage build and checks the size of the optimized image.
- **Step 4**: Finally, the script sends an email alert with the size of the optimized image.

---

## 🎯 Example Workflow
1. The script checks the Docker image size:
   - If the size is under 500MB, no action is taken.
   - If the size exceeds 500MB, an email alert is sent.
2. The script optimizes the image using a multi-stage build.
3. The size of the optimized image is checked.
4. An email alert is sent with the size of the optimized image.

## 🛠️ How to Use
1. Ensure you have Docker and Python installed on your system.
2. Set up a Gmail account to send email alerts. Update the `from_email`, `to_email`, and `password` fields in the script with your credentials.
3. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python optimize_docker_image.py
   ```

## 🧰 Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Docker
